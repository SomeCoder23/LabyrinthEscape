## Game Mechanics

- **Maze Generation**: Each level presents a new maze that increases in size and difficulty as you progress. The maze is filled with enemies, obstacles, and power-ups.

- **Power-Ups**:
  Players can take only one pill at a time.
  - **Green Pill**: Shrinks the player, allowing them to navigate through small doorways which the enemies can't path through, however this also shrinks their field of view.
  - **Turquoise Pill**: Enlarges the player, enabling them squish enemies and provides them with a wider field of view.
  - **Mixed Pill**: Grants a random effect, either shrinking or enlarging the player unpredictably.
  - **Purple Pill**: Activates a shield around the player, providing temporary invulnerability and the ability to push enemies away.

- **Enemies**: 
  - Mechanical spiders walk around the maze and chase the player when within range. The player must use their size-changing abilities or shield to avoid or repel them. As the player progresses through the levels the spiders' chasing speed and range increases making it more difficult to avoid them. The spiders emit eerie mechanical noises as they move, allowing the player to use these sounds to their advantage and detect when the spiders are nearby.
  
- **Survival and Strategy**: 
  - Players must balance exploration with survival, carefully choosing when to take pills and how to avoid or engage enemies.
  - The maze contains a light beam in the center, and a distance slider helps the player find their way by indicating how close they are to the light.
